    <h1> Adelyn's Faves </h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Adelyn and these are some of my favorite games! </p>
    
    <h2> 1. Cranium </h2>
    <p> This is a game I play with my family pretty frequently. It'a combo of a few other party games, which makes it super fun. There are 4 decks of cards,
      each one a different yet similar game. The Creative Cat cards give you a prompt to draw, and you play through much like Pictionary. 
      
      that you have to draw and make people guess like Pictionary. 
    Players roll the dice and move their customizable character across the board. First one to the brain at the center wins 
      It's for 4-16 people.
    
    Unfortunately, this game is quite pricy. With a suggested retail price of 49.99, its probably only worth it if you know you're going to play it. 
      It's quite worth it if you have a lot of friends or family

    <p> Uncharted 4 is a PS4 game that came out ______. You play as a man by the name of Nathan Drake, who is a treasure hunter.
In the preceding Uncharted games, he goes on many adventures and 
I personally played this game without playing any of the games before it, and had no troubles.</p>
