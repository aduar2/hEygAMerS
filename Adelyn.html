    <h1> Adelyn's Faves </h1>
    <p> Hello! My name is Adelyn and these are some of my favorite games! </p>
    
    <h2> 1. Cranium </h2>
    <p> This is a game I play with my family pretty frequently. It'a combo of a few other party games, which makes it super fun. There are 4 decks of cards,
      each one a different yet similar game. The Creative Cat cards give you a prompt to draw, and you play through much like Pictionary. 
      
      that you have to draw and make people guess like Pictionary. 
    Players roll the dice and move their customizable character across the board. First one to the brain at the center wins 
      It's for 4-16 people.
    
    Unfortunately, this game is quite pricy. With a suggested retail price of 49.99, its probably only worth it if you know you're going to play it. 
      It's quite worth it if you have a lot of friends or family

    <h2> 2. Uncharted 4 </h2>
    
    <img src= uncharted-4.jpg class = "uncharted"> </img>
    <p> Uncharted 4 is a PS4 game that came out in 2016. Developed by Naughty Dog, it is the 4th and final installment of the Uncharted series. 
      You play as a man by the name of Nathan Drake, who is a treasure hunter. He travels across the world in search of treasure and always seems 
      to run into trouble. There is quite a bit of combat in this game, but it also has a lot more to offer than that. It is heavily story driven, with pauses
      after combat for dialouge between characters and other cinematic sequences. Lovable characters, tons of backstory, allusion to historical events,
      and beautiful graphics are what made this game so fun for me.
    I personally played this game without playing any of the games before it, and felt no problem with that. I feel like the characters are properly introduced
and there's no real need to know the details of Nathan's previous adventures.
  This is definitely one of the best games I've ever played.</p>
