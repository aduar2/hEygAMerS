<p>hello and welcome to my page!<p>
  
    <h2>1. Loteria</h2>
   <img src = loteria.jpg class = "loteria"> </img>
    <p>Similar to bingo, loteria is a traditional mexican card game in which each player is given a card with 16 different images on them.
      The announcer reads from a stack of cards in the middle and if we have the image the announser said we put a object to keep tack
      (my family usually used beans or pennies).The goal is to the first to match four images in arow.
      I remember me and my family would get so competative during a game and my mother made the game harder by reading the stack of cards out really quickly. <p>
      
    <h2>2. UNO </h2>
    <img src = UNO.jpeg class = "UNO"> </img>
  <p>In UNO each player is given a total of 5 cards to start off and one by one each player lays down a card in a middle of a stack of extra cards. 
      The chosen card has to match the last cards color and/or number. 
     if the player doesnt have a card that meets those requirements the player must collect cards from the stack until they find a card that does.   
      The goal of the game is to be the first one to have cards left. what makes it so fun is that their are also trick cards that each player can use on one another.
    <p>
   
    <h2>3. Smash Bros</h2>
      <img src = Super Smash Bros.jpg class = "SuperSmashBros"> </img>
<p>Super Smash Bros is a fighting game in wichs it is the players objective to attack their opponent by knoking the out.
        To knock out your opponent you need to build up their damage and finnish off by hitting them off the edge
        the winner is the one who has taken less damage and how many times theyve knoced another player out. 
        each player can chose to play an array of characters that have special and unique moves. 
        you have an opportunity to collect character after each match.<p>
