    <h1>Types of Games</h1>
	  
	<h2> Board Games:</h2>
	  <p>
		  
		 Board Games are classics. The first known board game ever made was called Senet. It was found in ancient Egyptian burials from around 3300 BC.
		  
	  </p>
	  <h2> Card Games:</h2>
	  <p>
		We all get invested when we're in a good card game. The oldest card game known in the world was created around the  Ninth century 
		in china during the tang dynasty.  
	  </p>
	  <h2> Online Games:</h2>
	  <p>

		 Online games would be any game you find and play from a desktop or other means via the internet. Unfortunately, since the fall of Flash
		 many online games have become unavailable. A few examples are Poptropica, Animal Jam, Club Penguin, and Fireboy and Watergirl.
		  
	  </p>
	  <h2> Mobile Games:</h2>
	  <p>
		Mobile Games can be played on smartphones and are very common. They are found in the App store in great variety. 
		  
	  </p>
	  <h2> Console Games:</h2>
	  <p> 
		 The first console game was Pong, played on the Atari. It was released as an arcade game, but Atari Inc. converted it to the first home-console
		 in 1975. There were only a few games to play on the Atari, and the games were imbedded on the hardrive.
		  Console games have come a long way since then. The most popular gaming consoles now are the Microsoft Xbox, the Nintendo Switch, and
		  Sony's Playstation.
